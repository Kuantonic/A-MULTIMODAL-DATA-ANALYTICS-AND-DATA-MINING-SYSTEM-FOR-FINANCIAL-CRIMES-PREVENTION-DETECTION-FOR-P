The availability of structured datasets for data analytics on payroll, procurement, tax records, asset/income declarations, financial allocations/budgets, onshore &amp; offshore company &amp; properties registry &amp; finances  makes it possible to detect bribery, embezzlement, conflicts of interest, money laundering, tax evasion using Fraud Scenario, Scenario Matching &amp; Scenario Detection Technique trained using Machine learning models, and SQL Server VM on Azure.   The fraud detection process includes generation of fraud scenario definitions and the detection of fraudulent activities by matching the transactions, earnings/assets, tax records recorded in transaction &amp; non transaction logs. The software generates SQL queries from scenario definitions and then sends the query to the database. In this section, we describe the process of extracting transaction and non transaction log data from the system and the process of scenario detection.
